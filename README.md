# Introduction
Hi! I'm Sulaiman, a student in the Software Maintenance
and Evolution course.
I expect to learn a lot about modern software maintenance
practices and how to work with legacy systems.
- **Fun fact**: I love playing video games in my free time.
- **Course expectations**: To gain hands-on experience in
maintaining and evolving software.
